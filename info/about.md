### Who We Are

Matrix Development is a development group. We're a group that **develops** things. These things can range from Discord bots to videogames on different platforms. We're a development group striving to become one of the best development groups to ever exist. We are currently developing products on several platforms. Our only motive is reputation. That's practically the only thing we strive for. We were founded by a group of individuals influenced by their love for programming. We chose the name Matrix Development, because it's a combination of Cryptography and Software development which is what we do and what we aim to become better at to benefit others across the globe.
