Adix, our first high quality music bot meant to benefit the various communities on Discord by streaming music in a voice channel to entertain users. It comes with a wide variety of features most basic music bots don't have. You can use the help command (`a?help`) to view the server prefix, the bot's privacy policy, a list of all of the operational commands, and the support server. You can check out each feature from there with more detailed information. The following is a list of all Adix's categories and commands:\
