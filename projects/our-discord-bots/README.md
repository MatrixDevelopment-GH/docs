# Our Discord Bots

Discord, one of the biggest social-media platforms to ever exist. Our group is centered around the platform and most of the things we plan on developing are somewhat relative to it. One of the things we are currently developing, are Discord bots. These bots operate on their platform using their API to execute a series of commands ranging from features that are relative to fields regarding memes to fields regarding utility and moderation. Our current bots are relative to 4 of these fields: Utility, Moderation, Anime, and Music.
